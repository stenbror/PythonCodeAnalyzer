# PythonCodeAnalyzer

This will be a litle library written in C# for walking Python 3.9 abstract syntax tree produced by a parser. This will be a "Roslyn" like tool for analyzing your Python code and possible refactor it by using it in your own C# programs.

It is in early stage. It will be TDD and contains unittests for the part implemented.
